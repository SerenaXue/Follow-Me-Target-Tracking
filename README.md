# Follow Me - Target Identification & Tracking

##### In this project, I developed AI to achieve a drone tracking and following a specific target among a complex environment using the neural networks. Below are more details:
1. Built a Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN) in order to detect and recognize the target with its whole position information.
2. Collected data from the simulator and trained the network at `AWS` cloud.
3. Deployed and validated the model in the simulated environment with the accuracy of `77.8%` and the IoU of `58%`.
